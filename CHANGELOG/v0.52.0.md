:warning: **Breaking changes:**

- All methods which add actions to a statement now are prefixed with `to`. For example
the method `startInstances()` now is called `toStartInstances()`. The renaming was required to not conflict with reserved method names: In Java, methods cannot start with `get` as these are reserved for value getters.

- The method `allActions` no longer accepts regular expressions. Regular expressions must now be passed as strings: `allActions('/vpn/i')`. This was required as [JSII does not support regular expressions](https://github.com/aws/jsii/issues/1828).
