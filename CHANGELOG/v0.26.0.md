**Breaking changes:**

- iam-floyd no longer extends `iam.PolicyStatement` of CDK. In fact it no longer anything to do with the CDK. Therefore policy statements created via Floyd no longer can be directly passed to CDKs `iam.Policy` or any other CDK construct. Please switch to [cdk-iam-floyd](https://github.com/udondan/cdk-iam-floyd) if you want to do so.

- The method `not` has been renamed to `notActions`.

- The constructor signature of all provider classes has changed. The constructor now optionally takes a Sid instead of `iam.PolicyStatementProps`.
