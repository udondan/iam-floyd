#### FEATURES

1. new enum `AwsManagedPolicies`, which provides all ARNs of AWS managed polices ([483](https://github.com/udondan/iam-floyd/pull/483))

2. Adds missing (undocumented) operator `binaryNotEquals` ([481](https://github.com/udondan/iam-floyd/pull/481))

3. For easier access to simple operators, all operators now are additional available as static property. ([481](https://github.com/udondan/iam-floyd/pull/481))

   Instead of:

   ```ts
   new Operator().stringEquals()
   ```

   now you can do:

   ```ts
   Operator.stringEquals
   ```

   The methods are still available for generating more complex operators:

   ```ts
   new Operator().forAnyValue().stringEquals().ifExists()
   ```

#### ⚠️ BREAKING CHANGES

The `null` Operator now is **only** a static property instead of a method, since it cannot be combined with modifiers (`forAnyValue`, `forAllValues`, `ifExists`)

If you previously used `new Operator().null()` you now need to just use `Operator.null`
