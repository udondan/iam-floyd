- `if` and `to` methods now automatically add the service prefix, if none was given
- In rare cases, where actions started with a lower case character, the generated method was also completely lowercase, instead of camelCase. This has been fixed. For example the method `todocument()` of class Cloudsearch has been renamed to `toDocument()`
- The online documentation now contains a [policy converter](https://iam-floyd.readthedocs.io/en/latest/policy-converter.html).
