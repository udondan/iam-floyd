:warning: **Breaking changes:**

* Method `hasAction` has been renamed to `hasActions`.
* Method `hasResource` has been renamed to `hasResources`
* Method `hasCondition` has been renamed to `hasConditions`
* Method `notResource` has been renamed to `notResources`.

**Now two package variants are created from the same source:**

* **iam-floyd**: Can be used in AWS SDK, Boto 3 or for whatever you need an IAM policy statement for
* **cdk-iam-floyd**: Integrates into [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk/) and extends [`iam.PolicyStatement`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-iam.PolicyStatement.html)
