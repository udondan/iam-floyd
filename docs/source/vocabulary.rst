IAM Floyd provides a fluid interface and enables you to define policy statements in a human readable and easy to understand phrase.

**allow** | **deny** (Effect)
-----------------------------

The methods ``allow()`` and ``deny()`` control the `Effect <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_effect.html>`_ of the statement.

The default effect of any statement is ``Allow``, so it's not mandatory to add either of these methods to the method chain. Though it is recommended to keep the statement readable.
improve , so the statement is readable:

.. example:: allow-and-deny

**to** (Action)
---------------

Every available IAM `action`_ is represented by a distinct method. These methods start with ``to``. You allow/deny **to** *do something*

.. example:: allow


In case of `missing actions <faq.html#are-all-actions-conditions-resource-types-covered>`__, you can just add any action key yourself via ``to()``:

.. example:: actions-raw

**all** (Action)
----------------

While methods starting with ``to`` add a single action to a statement, methods starting with ``all`` add multiple `actions <action_>`_.

allActions
^^^^^^^^^^

This method adds all actions of the related service to the statement, e.g. `ec2:*`

.. example:: actions-all

allMatchingActions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Adds all actions matching regular expressions to the statement.

.. ATTENTION::
   The list of actions is compiled at run time. The generated statement object contains an exact list of actions that matched when you build it. If AWS later adds/removes actions that would match the regular expression, you need to re-generate the statements.

The regular expressions need to be in `Perl/JavaScript literal style <regex_>`_ and need to be passed as strings:

.. example:: actions-matching

Access levels
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To add all actions of a certain `access level <access-levels_>`_ to the statement use the below methods.

.. ATTENTION::
   The list of actions is compiled at run time. The generated statement object contains an exact list of actions that matched when you build it. If AWS later adds/removes actions or changes the level, you need to re-generate the statements.

allListActions
""""""""""""""

Adds all actions with `access level <access-levels_>`_ **list** to the statement.

.. example:: access-levels-list

allReadActions
""""""""""""""

Adds all actions with `access level <access-levels_>`_ **read** to the statement.

.. example:: access-levels-read

allWriteActions
"""""""""""""""

Adds all actions with `access level <access-levels_>`_ **write** to the statement.

.. example:: access-levels-write

allPermissionManagementActions
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Adds all actions with `access level <access-levels_>`_ **permission management** to the statement.

.. example:: access-levels-permission-management

allTaggingActions
"""""""""""""""""

Adds all actions with `access level <access-levels_>`_ **tagging** to the statement.

.. example:: access-levels-tagging

**if** (Condition)
------------------

Every available IAM `condition`_ key is represented by a distinct method. These methods start with ``if``. You allow/deny something **if** a condition is met.

Every statement provider (e.g. ``Ec2``) brings its unique conditions. `Global condition context keys <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html>`_ start with ``ifAws``.

.. NOTE::
   Multiple conditions on a statement all have to be true.

   When you have multiple values on a single condition, one of them has to be true.

   Other than that, IAM has no concept of ``OR``. You need to define multiple statements for each ``OR`` branch.

.. example:: conditions

Every ``if`` method has a default operator. For instance, conditions which operate on strings usually have ``StringLike`` as default. Most methods allow you to pass an operator as last argument.

.. example:: conditions-operator-string

In case of `missing conditions <faq.html#are-all-actions-conditions-resource-types-covered>`__, you can define just any condition yourself via ``if()``:

.. example:: conditions-raw

Operators
^^^^^^^^^

`Condition operators <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html>`_ can just be passed as strings. Or you can use the class ``statement.Operator()``:

.. example:: conditions-operator-all-values

.. example:: conditions-operator-any-value

.. example:: conditions-operator-if-exists

**on** (Resource)
-----------------

Every available IAM `resources <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_resource.html>`_ key is represented by a distinct method. These methods start with ``on``. You allow/deny something **on** a specific resource (or pattern).

.. example:: resource

In case of `missing resources <faq.html#are-all-actions-conditions-resource-types-covered>`__ or if you already have an ARN ready, use the ``on()`` method:

.. example:: resource-raw


If no resources are applied to the statement without principals, it defaults to all resources (``*``).

**for** (Principal)
-------------------

.. NOTE::
   If you use the CDK variant of the package, don't attempt to create an assume policy with this package. Assume policies have to be of type ``IPrincipal`` and can easily be created with the `iam <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/aws-iam-readme.html>`_ package.

Every possible `principal <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html>`_ is represented by a distinct method. These methods start with ``for``. You allow/deny something **for** a specific principal.

.. example:: principal

The CDK variant of the package has an additional method ``forCdkPrincipal``, which takes any number of `iam.IPrincipal <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/latest/docs/@aws-cdk_aws-iam.IPrincipal.html>`_ objects:

.. example:: principal-cdk

**not** (notAction, notResource and notPrincipal)
-------------------------------------------------

.. WARNING::
   Make sure, you well understand the concepts of `notAction <NotAction_>`_, `notResource <NotResource_>`_ and `notPrincipal <NotPrincipal_>`_. This is where things quickly go wrong, especially when used in combination.

notActions
^^^^^^^^^^

Switches the policy provider to use `NotAction`_.

.. example:: notAction

notResources
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Switches the policy provider to use `NotResource`_.

.. example:: notResource

notPrincipals
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Switches the policy provider to use `NotPrincipal`_.

.. example:: notPrincipal
